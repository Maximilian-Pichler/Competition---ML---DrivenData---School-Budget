# Machine Learning - DrivenData Challenge - School Budget
Participated in a DrivenData competition (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/46/box-plots-for-education-reboot/leaderboard/)
At the time of writing this, I am hodling place 42 on the leaderboard.

The main goal was to learn about Sklearn's machine learning/label prediction capabilities.

__The process was as follows:__

- feature extraction
- trainingset splits
- model training
